<h4 align="left" style=color:#3366FF;margin-left:280px;>Help bring hope, strength and joy to wish kids around the world.</h4>
<p  align="justify" class="main" style=margin-right:250px>The Make-A-Wish Foundation® grants the wishes of children with life-threatening medical conditions to enrich the human experience with hope, strength and joy. With the help of generous donors and nearly 30,000 volunteers, the Make-A-Wish Foundation grants a wish every 40 minutes and has granted more than 240,000 wishes in the United States since its inception.

Approximately 70 percent of all wishes involve travel and hotel stays. "I wish to go to see the monarch butterflies in Mexico" or "I wish to go to my grandparents' farm in England" are examples of wish experiences that require donated frequent flier miles and hotel reward points. With the help of generous supporters, wish destinations can be as limitless as a wish kids' imaginations.
